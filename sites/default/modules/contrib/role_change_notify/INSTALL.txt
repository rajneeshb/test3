Installation:
-------------
1. Copy the role_change_notify.module to sites/all/modules

2. Enable the module by visiting admin/build/modules

3. Configure the module under administer >> settings >> Role Change Notify
   - Enable notifications on each desired role
   - (Optionally) Customize notification subject and text.

4. Ensure your site's "E-mail address" setting is defined, which is
   used as the "From" header for all outgoing emails. You can find the
   setting on the administer >> settings page, under the "General
   settings" set of choices. If this is not set, the user status
   module will not be able to send notification emails.

5. You may optionally install and enable the 
   - token module, http://drupal.org/project/token, which will provide many more 
     tokens for your message.
   - profile module, which will provide profile tokens for use in your message.
   - trigger module (with token actions module), so that the module can provide
     triggers which fire on role add and role remove (individual and global).
