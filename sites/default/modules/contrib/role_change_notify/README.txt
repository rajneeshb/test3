Description

This module enables sites to automatically send customized email
notifications to users when a new role is assigned to them.

It has a configuration page at admin/user/role_change_notify.
In addition, it provides a trigger, so if the Trigger module and the 
Token Actions module are enabled, actions can be taken when a role is
added or removed.

Installation
